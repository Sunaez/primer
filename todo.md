# Tasks to do
## Report related
1. Find one more game to implement, discuss and write code for
2. Start section 3(/4) slowly and discuss implementation


## Immediate tasks
### Code Related

* Add more content for onboarding to explain in more detail
* Make the play button on the daily page work
* Start planning how to add the activities feature now that we have blaze set up
* Also consider Daily streak implementation - Where do we begin?
* Add pictures to make it more engaging
    * for freeplay - This could be a short picture or a video that actually explains how the game works -D (just got reaction + stroop left)
* In each game, Indicate their previous highest score and whether this score is a new high score
* add a way of explaining why this actually is useful (maybe a question mark with the games description and video which references the report, explaining why its a good game to play consistently)

### Report Related
* justify defaulting dark mode in report
* Reference humanbenchmark for the pairs explanation 273ms, doubling it because you react to two things
* Make a graph for each of the equations that are used, all of them.


## Front End
### Game related
3. Start making code for:
 1. N-back (maybe the GTA game where there's 6 buttons)
 3. Tetris
### Not Game Related

## Back End
### Not API Related
Deb suggested chatbots + more aesthetics

## ideas
* Consider how you can engage users
 * Animations
 * Special effects
 * Videos and additional images
* Password hasing - Prevent MITM attacks
* Use more React Native reanimated
* Generate individual reports for each user
 * Similar to spotify wrapped
* Password stuff (min length / security)


between 10k - 15k words for report
presentation for demo needs to be done after report is completed
25 minutes to show complete work
Start with a bit of the code
Explain features from the code
Go to presentation and demo the working code
* When presenting, animations would be really nice to add, whether to show the app icon for the framework
 * Also animations for each graph thats used
