Deb suggested chatbots + more aesthetics

## ideas

between 10k - 15k words for report
presentation for demo needs to be done after report is completed
25 minutes to show complete work
Start with a bit of the code
Explain features from the code
Go to presentation and demo the working code
* When presenting, animations would be really nice to add, whether to show the app icon for the framework
 * Also animations for each graph thats used
